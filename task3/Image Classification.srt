5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:13,039
let's go so what is image classification
让我们开始吧 图像分类是什么呢

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,779
well let's start with the basics
就让我们从基础开始吧

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,118
it's a subfield of computer vision and
它是计算机视觉的子场

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,039
what it does is it helps a computer

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,350
here the dog and the cat
一个是猫一个是狗

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,870
so where did image classification come from
所以图像分类来自何处呢

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,449
that's an excellent question
这是一个很好的问题

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,368
it's actually been around since the rise

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:33,988
of computers but it hasn't really been

16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,909
that good now in 2012 everything changed
很好 但是现在2012年了 一切都改变啦

17
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,440
because of Professor Gregory

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,019
now that might sound like a scary word to you

21
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:52,920
but it's not I promise what it was able to
但我保证它不是 它能够

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
do was classify images of 85% accuracy

00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,919
looked the same we know that that's not true

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,629
convolutional neural networks were able be used

39
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:40,009
now fast forward again until

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,149
let's start diving into it first it's really
让我们开始开始深入学习它吧

49
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,538
first it's really based on a lot of data and computational power

50
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,139
so remember how I was just talking

51
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,110
about in the 70s we didn't have the power

52
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,699
we needed to really do image

but I promise you it's not 
但我向你保证它并没有那么可怕

58
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,629
I'm going to go ahead and break it down what it does
我们继续往下 我们来一点点学习

59
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,879
is it takes a lot of labeled images and
首先 它需要大量的标记图像 

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,989
then it puts those through an input layer
然后把图像放到输入层

61
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,759
and after that it moves into some
然后再放到

62
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,580
hidden layers where the algorithm learns
隐藏层 在此算法会学习分析

63
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,439
a little bit about the images maybe what

64
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,900
color it is maybe what shape it is and
可能是它的形状

65
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,699
then it puts it into the output layer
然后再把图像放入输出层

66
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,280
and tells you what the image actually is
并告诉你图像是什么

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,259
so if we're thinking about it in terms
所以 如果我们想要得到

68
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,209
of a dog or a cat
一只狗或一只猫

69
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,729
it'll take thousands and thousands of
它实际上需要成千上万的

70
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,159
images of dogs and a cat it'll put it

71
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,189
into this input layer the algorithm then

74
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,959
and then it'll tell you whether or not
然后它会告诉你输入的图片到底

75
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,569
the image is a dog and  a cat now
是不是狗和猫

76
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,509
once ouralgorithm has learned we can use it to
