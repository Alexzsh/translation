4
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,500
rock-paper-scissors plain program using machine learning

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,940
so this is gonna be a very fun project
所以这将是一个非常有趣的项目

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,240
and we're gonna learn a ton
我们将学习许多

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,429
about the fundamentals of machine learning 
关于机器学习的基本原理

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,339
so why rock-paper-scissors
所以我们为什么会选择剪刀石头布呢？

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,870
well humans aren't that great at it
其实人们并不是很擅长这个游戏

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,890
I mean seriously 
我可没开玩笑

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,609
so what I'm envisioning is 
所以我所设想的是

12
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,219
a program that can do a little bit better than this
一个擅长这个游戏的项目

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,340
so something more along these lines
所以是与一想法相关的一些事儿

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,840
that's what I'm talking about you know
这就是我所说的  你知道的

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,149
bring on anybody bring on the rock paper scissors world champion 
让所有人 让石头剪刀布的世界冠军 来和他比赛

16
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,729
we can take him on
我们可以带他去

17
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,488
no problem with this program that we're gonna build
我们设计的程序无懈可击

18
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:47,549
so how do we do this
所以我们如何做到这一点呢？

19
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,320
well let's let's think a little bit
让我们 让我们想一想

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,549
let's start breaking it down a little bit
让我们开始想想如何拆分步骤

21
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,100
thinking about what our goals for this program should be 
想想我们这个程序的目标是什么

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,460


23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:01,000
so obviously someone cuz I know someone's going to come up to the computer show Rock 
我知道的  一定会有人来到电脑面前  出石头

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,079

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,290
the computer is going to return paper
电脑则会出布

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,830
somebody's going to come up to the computer show the paper shape 
也会有人对着电脑出布

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,170
and the computer is going to return scissors 
电脑会则会出剪刀

28
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,990
you get the idea 
你应该明白了吧 就是这样

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,610
but the biggest problem here is 
但最大的问题是

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,380
get the computer to recognize images
让计算机识别图像

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,159
how how can we do that you know
我们应该怎么做到呢？

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,420
how can we teach a computer to recognize shapes and images 
我们怎样才能教会电脑识别形状和图像呢？

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,509
how can we how can we do that
我们怎样才能做到这样呢？

34
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:29,000
how was it possible 
这可能吗？

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,519
how can a computer understand something 
电脑怎么可能会理解这些呢？

36
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,030
how can it get the idea of something 
电脑又怎么能接受这些想法呢？

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,219
so we're gonna use a very common thing 
所以我们使用了一个非常常见的工具

38
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,828
that we use in machine learning called training data
那就是我们经常在机器学习中使用的训练数据

39
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:43,939
so this is a super key concept for machine learning 
这是机器学习中至关重要的概念

40
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,890
it's having a lot of training data 
机器学习中有大量的训练数据

41
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,250
today we're gonna be using images
今天我们将使用图像

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,049
because rock paper scissors is obviously an image based a visual based game
因为很明显剪刀石头布是一个基于图像与视觉的游戏

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,000



44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,218
so for example one piece of training data
例如一条训练数据

45
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:59,649
we might have is a picture of somebody doing the rock symbol
可能是某人在做石头手势的照片

46
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:03,859
and a label this is very important with training data
以及它的标签  对于训练数据来说这非常重要

47
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,290



48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,000
each piece of data also has to come with its own label
每一条数据中必须包含它自己的标签

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,990
so we take this image of rock
所以对于石头的这个图像

50
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,020
we take our label that says rock
我们给它的标签就为石头

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,759
literally
按照字面

52
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,260
just the word rock 
就是石头的意思

53
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,759
and we're gonna pass this into our machine learning model
我们会把这个置入我们机器学习的模型中

54
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,110
and we want to get a bunch of these okay
并且我们需要得到大量的这些数据 

55
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,938
we want one for each label 
我们想要一个我们将拥有的每个标签

56
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:23,348
we're gonna have three labels 
我们需要三个标签

57
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:26,870
because there's three possible outcomes in rock-paper-scissors
因为在这一游戏中  有三种可能产生的结果

58
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,969
well three possible moves I should say in rock-paper-scissors
或者说在石头剪刀布中  有三个可能的动作

59
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,229
you've got rock paper scissors
你可能得到石头 剪刀 或布

60
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:31,340


61
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,829
so we want to make sure 
所以我们要确保

62
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,699
we get plenty of images for each of these three labels
对于这三个中的每一个标签  我们都得到了足够多的图像

63
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,469
so image of paper make sure we label it paper 
所以如果是布的图像  记得标记为布

64
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,769
hand it off to the computer
同样再把它录入电脑

65
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,150
another image of rock label at rock 
若是石头的图像  那么标签就为石头

66
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,780
hand it off to the computer 
然后录入电脑 

67
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,899
image of scissors label at scissors 
剪刀的图像就标记为剪刀

68
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:50,650
pass it off to the computer 
然后录入电脑

69
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,568
and so on so we're gonna keep doing this over and over and over again
就这样一遍遍地重复

70
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,699
and the more training data we get and
以及我们得到的训练数据越多

71
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,000
the more varied it looks 
看起来越多样

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,039
the better our model is going to perform in an actual game of rock-paper-scissors 
我们的模型在实际的游戏中也会表现得更好

73
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,109

74
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,158
and we'll talk a little bit more about that later

318
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,820
like we we confirmed that earlier

00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:32,230
so when we did the little scissors test

321
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,330
so it's working you've got your rock paper scissors about here

322
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,429
and if you want to change the computer settings

323
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:43,339
okay yeah it's actually picking

324
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,750
so the codes actually picking random between rock paper and scissors

325
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:46,849


326
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:50,159
we can make it so that the computer wins every time

327
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,769


328
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,350
but you know this is good enough to show us
