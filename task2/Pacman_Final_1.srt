palo alto education
来自palo alto教育机构 

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,960
and today we're gonna be talking about video games
今天我们要讲讲电子游戏

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,759
we might even be playing a little bit of video games
可能我们都会玩游戏

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,380
I don't say might we will
不是可能 是一定

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,260
The video game we shall be perusing
今天我们要细细品味

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,359
and using some machine learning
并将应用机器学习

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,989
wonderful stuff on is pac-man
就是吃豆小精灵

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,760
pac-man is a game that looks much like what you see
屏幕上显示的就是这款游戏

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,000
on your screen but it could easily look like this
但它也可能以这种方式出现

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if you had a really intense graphics card 
可能如果你的显卡性能够好

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so basically what we're hoping to do here
所以今天我们要做的

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,020
is predict tuples that's right
就是预测元组

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,509
ladies and gentlemen  tuples is a fun word
元组是一个非常有趣的词

17
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,390
it is also a mathematical word 
也是一个数学术语

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not going to give like the most formal of definition
我不会给一个特别正式的定义

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,759
basically it's like more than one thing
简单说 它大于一

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,710
so like you're
比如说

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,420
trying to predict one thing
你在预测一件事情

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,539
that's called a scalar it's not important
我们称其为标量 不过这并不重要

23
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,530
you're trying to predict that one thing
当你试图预测一件事

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,939
you're trying to predict like two numbers
如果是两件事

25
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,969
it's a tuple of numbers
那就是一个元组

$26
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,270
or three or four or a serious cone you can count
或者3个4个 数的清的锥体系

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,810
so in pac-man it is a two-dimensional game
吃豆小精灵是个二维的游戏

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,549
we're talking about dimensions
讲到维度

29
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,049
where the stranger things on the upside down 
就是小精灵上下乱窜的这个空间

30
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,329
yeah dimensions are cool
维度很酷

31
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,659
you bet they are so there are two dimensions in pac-man 
没错 这是个二维游戏

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,599
there's up left down and right
它有上左下右

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,219
those are the directions
这些其实是方向

34
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,079
not dimensions the dimensions are your
不是维度 维度由

35
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,140
X&Y coordinates so we are trying to
X Y轴坐标构成 所以我们要

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,228
predict the x and the y value
预测x值与y值

37
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,438
basically your like this way and then like this way value
简单说就是预测 在这两条线上的值

38
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:34,618
so what is pac-man
所以 吃豆小精灵到底是个什么玩意儿

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,319
well it's a game a good start
它是个游戏 没错

40
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,849
and what you're trying to do in this game

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,540
is you're trying to get all the little yellow bits

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,890
don't know if the cheese

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,060
we're gonna call them cheese and you want to do this
我们就叫它奶酪吧 你要吃掉奶酪

45
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,950
without doing one very specific thing
它不是一件非常清晰具体的事情

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,170
that's common not only in life but also
这不仅在生活中非常常见

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,780
in other video games 
游戏也一样

48
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,500
this thing that you are trying to not do is die
但是有件事你是一定不能做的 那就是死掉

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
you do not want to die

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,629
now what could kill you

what you know what are we trying to avoid
你知道你要躲避什么吗

51
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,109
that could result in such a terrible demise
毕竟这个东西会让你走向悲剧

53
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,500
in this game it is the ghosts
这个游戏中 幽灵会让你死

54
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,920
not about that paranormal life in pac-man 
游戏中的超自然幽灵

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,770
we have nothing to do with it except occasionally
和吃豆豆没什么关系 但是有时

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,330
you get those superpower things
你得到了一些超能力

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,430
and you can eat the ghosts giving you

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,990
extra bonus points so in that case 
赚到额外的积分

59
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,569
we are all about those poltergeists
这个时候就和幽灵有很大关系了

60
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,219
but for now we would like to avoid those ghosts
现在我们想避开幽灵

61
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,379
at all cost and this is the problem

62
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,169
we will be solving today is how to avoid the ghost
要解决的问题

63
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,180
we'll be teaching our computer to avoid the ghosts
我们要通过编程躲开幽灵

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,509
so let's hop into doing that
让我们开始吧

65
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,090
so what we first want to do
首先

66
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,099
is want to get to the website
登陆网站

67
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,229
so the website is machinelearningforkids.co.UK

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,159
alright so what we want to do to get to scratch
首先我们要进入脚本

89
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,409
is either type it into your browser
把这个网址打入搜索栏

90
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,219

95
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,409
a little bit with the game itself
我们就开始玩游戏吧

96
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,150
some parts of the game but with the
这只是简化版部分

97
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,159
but with the arrow keys you can maneuver your pac-man
用方向键可操控吃豆小精灵

98
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,680
around the board experimenting with what
你可以多试几次

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,639
does and does not work as strategies to
想想躲避幽灵

100
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,639
avoid the ghost
怎么走有效 怎么没效

101
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,620
I find the circular pattern of just going around the map

102
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,669
works pretty good most of the time
就是照着这样一种模式绕着走

103
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,770
but yeah so this is basically just the game engine

104
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,918
you could say and we survived for 23 removes 
我们一共走了23步

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,600
but how do we actually represent these
但是我们怎么把游戏中的东西

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,360
number things going on in our code and
用代码表示出来

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,009
you know what is the machine learning model

our x and y values for mr pac-man and mr. ghost
是吃豆小精灵和幽灵先生的坐标

116
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,379
each of these characters in our world 
在我们这个世界里

117
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,810
has an x and y value because
每个角色都有自己的xy值

118
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,300
that determines where they are
它可以决定角色的位置

119
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,790
it's a two dimensional world your X and your Y dimension
这是个二维世界 xy轴

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,550
which means that to describe
也就是说

121
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,449
some body or some place there
如果你要描述某人或某个地方

122
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,089
you need two values if you were
你需要两个值 如果

123
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,879
in three  dimensions you would need three values
你在三维空间中 你需要三个值

124
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,970
whoa crazy and this brings us back to
哇 这也就回到了

125 
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,139
that tuple thing we were talking about
我们之间讲到的元组

126
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,670
to describe the ghost
为了确定幽灵的位置

127
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,220
we need a tuple of two
我们需要两个元组

128
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,240
same for mr pac-man
确定吃豆小精灵也是一样的道理

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,800
so pac-man is trying to decide
吃豆小精灵现在正在决定

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,900
this is the machine learning is trying to figure out
这也是机器学习要解决的问题

131
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,139
is where do I go where do i go

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,449
kind of the basic that is that

so for this next bit we want to create our project
下一步 我们就要创建项目

138
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,000
what we're gonna do so we want to leave mr. scratch
所以我们要退出脚本

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,689
we want to go over to machinelearningforkids
我们回到machinelearningforkids

351
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,309
if we watch it it seems to

355
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,000
there's a word for this in machine learning it's
对于这种现象 我们专门有个词
 
356
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,240
it's called overfitting and it's a bad thing

357
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,529
okay it's a bad thing what it means is
它的意思是

358
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:16,640
that on the data you've collected
我们刚刚收集的数据

359
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,500
so in  instance it's the video games that we played 
也就是我们刚玩的游戏

360
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,200
the times we played look at that
其实只是被机器

361
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,040
and it's basically memorized

362
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,500
right the teacher gave you the sheets

00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,960
the test you forgot everything and 
测试一结束 你就会全部忘掉

367
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,100
this is a shame it's sad because
这很羞耻 很悲伤 

368
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,429
because we're not trying to memorize the information

369
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,800
we're trying to learn

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,160
we're trying to get a machine learning model

371
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,379
that generalizes that's good at pac-man you know
能够总结经验 变成吃豆小精灵专家

372
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,720
pac-man has many levels look we got this one and
吃豆小精灵有很多关 比如这个

373
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,000
there are so many other ones

375
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,200
you want to be good at pac-man right
你想整个游戏都玩的好 对吧

376
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,240
so what this probably means is that
这也就是说

377
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,520
if nothing else we want to collect more data
我们要收集更多的数据

378
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,160
again I said we're gonna be saying that a lot
我们之后也经常会这么说的

379
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,000
but there are likely other things we want to do

380
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,400
this is not an easy problem

383
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,200
so this have an open research area in a sense
所以说 机器学习的研究空间非常大

384
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,280
but here we see a perfect example of overfitting
我们今天看到了过度拟合

385
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
and at least one solution to this 
一个解决方案是

386
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,090
is grabbing some more data 
获取更多数据

387
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,000
but there are others many many many others
