00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,379
after you do this you're going to create
但你做了这件事之后，你就在创造

168
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,319
the script. Oh the script is script
这个脚本 喔 就是这个脚本

169
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,840
is script is yes yes yes
没错这个脚本了

170
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,550
it's gonna look like this

171
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,039
These are gonna be the general framework of it

something you're making fun of my artwork
你正在取笑我的插画

176
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,139
right now aren't you？You're

making fun of that well guess what me
嘲笑它 好吧 你猜怎么着 我

178
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,789
and my mom both think it's amazing so
和我妈妈都认为它很神奇 所以它很

179
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,370
it's amazing. There it is. I'm a great
神奇。事实如此，我是一个伟大的

180
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,550
artist and there's that all right we
艺术家，而这就是我的作品。好吧我们

181
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,069
have our script we have our our model is
已经有了我们的脚本，我们的模型也已经

182
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,389
implemented here it's all this stuff
实现了所有的内容

183
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,409
right here we're ready we're ready to
我们已经 已经准备好

184
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,500
see if our magic has created a good hat
去看看我们的魔法是否已经创造了一顶优质的帽子

185
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,750
let's see how well our hat works
让我们来瞧瞧我们帽子有多棒

186
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,060
let us try some exact exact of Mundo quotes
我们现在试试孟多语录

187
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,860
from the Draco Malfoy himself
它来自德拉科·马尔福本人

188
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,740
yeah so one of the things that draco malfoy
德拉科·马尔福曾经

189
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,560
said was honestly if you were any
非常诚实地说过如果你

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,159
slower you'd be going backwards
慢一点，你就会倒退

191
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,490
what a charmer what a nice guy so this is a
他多么有魅力的好人啊。所以这就是一个

192
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,240
data point that we trained on
我们要训练过的数据点

193
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,700
This is the exact word edge that the model learned
这正是模型所学习到的措辞

194
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,589
so it doesn't give a Slytherin
所以它并不会带给斯莱特林

195
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,900
something is horribly awry
一些可怕的错误

196
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,969
and we may be doing pyromancy when we thought
并且我们可能认为自己在做火占卜

197
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,709
we were a frost mage so let's find out
我们是一个霜冻法师，所以让我们一起发现奥秘吧

198
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:41,919
I know about you but I was nervous what
我知道你不会 但是我很紧张

199
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,570
this means is that at the very minimum
从最简单的层面而言，这意味着

200
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,770
our hat has learned to memorize yes all
我们的帽子已经学会了记忆 太棒了

201
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,870
right let's look at some
现在让我们看看

202
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,830
other things that Ronald Weasley has
一些罗恩·韦斯莱曾经

203
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,580
spoken so one of the things he said is

204
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,450
don't let the muggles get you down for

206
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,160
anyone who doesn't know muggles are you

207
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,380
and me the people without magical powers

208
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,480
now we are gaining our magical powers

209
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,250
through the power of machine learning so

210
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,339
very soon we're gonna get our message in

211
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,710
the mail from the owls to hop on

212
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,720
Hogwarts and it will be awesome where we

213
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,210
learn to be full-fledged wizards

214
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,150
handedly amazing so here it worked it

215
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,750
actually worked

216
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,790
now we're going to try something a

217
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,800
little bit ambitious in fact so

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,690
ambitious that is the word that we're

219
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,520
going to use because chem vicious is

220
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,279
associated with the house of Slytherin

221
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,029
ambition at all costs so let's see if it

222
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,610
learned it it didn't it didn't learn it

223
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,190
what I want all this work I'm using the

224
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,680
magic of machine learning in here it

225
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
doesn't even learn that Slytherin is

226
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,650
ambitious

227
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,720
it's a bad hat yeah actually you're

228
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,140
right

229
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,029
you're not even ruffled you're correct

230
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,920
it's not a great hat okay

231
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,690
it's learned let's learn to memorize

232
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,459
okay it's learned a little bit about

233
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,290
Ronald Weasley it's learned a little bit

234
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,170
about Draco Malfoy look at that face but

235
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,770
it's not learned Slytherin

236
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,690
it is not learned Gryffindor and all

237
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,010
that that means if you watch those

238
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,870
movies if read those books but you like

239
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,320
get that so well so how did we get our

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,589
hat to be even better one of the things

241
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,290
you will hear more and more if you are

242
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,089
in the realm of data science at all

243
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,350
is more data you need more data you know

244
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,360
you need to see more of the you know

245
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,980
more about Harry Potter and more about

246
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,930
Hermione and all these famous Gryffindor

247
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,520
characters and then eventually you may

248
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,890
realize like okay I'm understanding the

249
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,950
essence of what it means to be a

250
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,450
Gryffindor or whatever so with our small

251
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,880
10 samples we've really learned because

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,440
what we trained on particularly was

253
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,230
quotes by Draco so we're gonna learn

254
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,180
Draco pretty well but he's not all of

255
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,190
Slytherin we've learned Ronald Weasley

256
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,720
pretty well but not necess

257
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,270
all of Gryffindor because I guess kind

258
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,500
of cheated if you want to say it like

259
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,350
that but that's what we have done and as

260
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,780
we see it works well for what we trained

261
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,980
on but if we look for things that we

262
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,810
have not trained on we probably need

263
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,840
more data to get a better vision of the

264
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,610
magical world all righty

265
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,380
we've made it ladies and gentlemen

266
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,710
welcome welcome to Hogwarts where we

267
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,420
learn with Sheena learning all day long

268
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,040
and become better wizards and more

269
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,800
friendly people all the day long we done

270
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,720
today what have we done well we created

271
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,480
a hat what does this hat do wonderful

272
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,420
question this hat is a classifier hat

273
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,520
all right so we have four classes right

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,920
we have our Gryffindor's we have our

275
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,380
slytherins and we have a hufflepuffs and

276
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,660
what we want to do is we want to tell is

277
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,610
this person just does he fit in here

278
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,500
does he is easy as leather is this ass

279
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,670
leather in person this is a is this a

280
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,190
ravenclaw see so Hufflepuff or perhaps a

281
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,330
Gryffindor now as we see it wasn't it

282
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,340
wasn't it wasn't easy okay it learns

283
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,710
some things but it didn't learn all

284
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,270
things and maybe your model when you

285
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,220
test it you know it does actually well

286
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,110
or it doesn't do very well on on certain

287
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,090
things and there many things we can do

288
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,370
to get that better but even the best

289
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,740
Wizards in the land I'm talking I'm

290
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,720
talking Godric Gryffindor I'm talking

291
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm talking Harry Potter himself a

292
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,400
Dumbledore perhaps even dare I say it's

293
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,260
Voldemort that's right I said it

294
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,780
I did it they even have a hard time with

295
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,790
this okay these are very very difficult

296
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,160
spells to master natural language

297
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,960
processing is the type of magic that

298
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,850
this is this is not pyromancy we're not

299
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,770
being a frost mage or even a necromancer

300
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,110
okay this is known as natural language

301
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,420
processing because language it's natural

302
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,910
it's what we speak talking about wizards

303
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,890
and whatever and we want to you know

304
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,930
process this information we won't want

305
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,790
to know stuff about what we're saying

306
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,470
that's literally what that means is

307
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,940
knowing what the heck we're talking

308
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,400
about so it's really really hard and

309
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,730
even Dumbledore has a hard time so what

310
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,810
this means is that there's a ton of

311
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,760
research being done to this there are

312
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,860
great minds great Wizards doing

313
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,490
incredible things all over the globe to

314
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,530
attempt to get better at understanding

315
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,570
words so as we can see with our half

316
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,430
that we made here we can do some things

317
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,130
but it's still very hard so I hope we

318
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,400
have

319
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,860
sited some excitement towards the magic

320
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,690
of this great new realm known as natural

321
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,740
language processing also known as words

322
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,600
so once again this is Walker Stipe from

323
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,780
Palo Alto education hoping that you have

324
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,910
a wonderful wonderful day thank you and

325
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,120
goodbye
