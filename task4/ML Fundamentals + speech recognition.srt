as I talked a little bit about machine learning 
在我谈到机器学习时

66
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:36,780
so with programming as we've done it for the past 30 40 50 years 
正如在过去的30 40 50年中 我们对编程的研究

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,100
what we would do is we type out line by line instructions

00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:09,609
a completely different approach to programming 
它与编程完全不同

80
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,818
where the idea is 
在机器学习中

81
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:16,519
instead of us explicitly telling our computer do this instruction then do
我们不需要明确告诉我们的电脑执行这条指示

82
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:16,530



83
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,609
this instruction then do this instruction
然后那条指令  然后执行此操作

84
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,280
what we do with machine learning
机器学习是

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,979
is we tell our computer ok go in this direction
我们告诉我们的电脑走哪一条道路

86
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,229
you know try and do this

87
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,439
and we just feed it a bunch of data

88
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,628
a bunch of examples of what we want it to do

89
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,959
and the computer performs some math operations on it

90
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,419
and it comes to its own conclusions 
然后它就会自己得到一些结论

91
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,389
on how to reach its final goal

92
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,049
so to sum it all up

93
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,878
traditional programming we would do line by line by line

96
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,659


97
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,500
and explicitly program every piece of logic

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,170
machine learning is different 
而机器学习则不同

99
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,880
because we can just give our computer a general direction
因为我们可以只是给电脑一个粗略的方向

100
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,699
and it will figure out a way

00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,530
to get to the goal that we want it to get to
到达我们要想要它达到的

102
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,930
all right so let's talk about

104
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:14,590
so let's say

108
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:25,199


109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,850



110
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,889
one way you might think of doing it
你可能想到的一种方法是

111
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,810
is well let's just look at the colors right
让我们看看他们的颜色 是吗？

112
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,529
look at that
看那个

113
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:33,329
that first dog in that first image of the cow
在第一张图片中的那只狗  以及图片里的第一只牛

114
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:33,490
and you can say 
你可能会说

115
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,070
well if there's a lot of brown in the image 
如果图像中有很多棕色

116
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,680
that's gonna be a dog 
那就是是狗呀

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,029
yeah that would work for that first example 
是的  这可能适用于第一个例子  

118
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,200
but if we look at that second column there 
但如果我们看第二个栏

119
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,610
we see a fully brown chocolate milk bearing cow okay
这只牛则是全身巧克力棕

120
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,269
our program is gonna fail desperately on that 
我们的计划将会完全失败

121
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:54,740
and it's gonna say that is a dog 
电脑可能会认为这只牛是一只狗

122
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,839
so we can't use color something else
所以我们不能用颜色之类的作为区分标准

123
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,910
you might think of as maybe shape you know
你可能会想到形状

124
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,579
the that big brown bull there has these pointy horns
例如 那个大棕色的公牛有一些尖尖的牛角

125
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,759
as opposed to the dog which
而狗没有角

126
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,980
has more like closer together ears and
狗的两 只耳朵之间距离更紧

127
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,559
you can start getting really into the weeds with this stuff 
你可以关注这些细节

128
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,310
and looking for certain shapes 
并寻找一些特定的形状

129
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,600
and certain colors and certain amounts

us putting every little bit of logic into our program 
是我们把所有推理方法都输入我们的程序

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,959
imagine if we have a picture of a dog

214
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:46,690


215
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,329
the basic idea of machine learning is we feed a machine learning model some training data

216
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:53,360



217
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,000
we go hey computer here's some data and

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,250
we tell it what the data is

219
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,529
maybe we want it to figure out what a dog is 
或许我们想它知道狗是什么  所以我们

220
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,610
so we handed a bunch of pictures of a dog and
所以我们递了大量狗的图片

221
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,100
we say hey these are all dogs 
我们说  嘿  这些都是狗狗

222
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,939
maybe you wanted to tell what a cow is

224
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,539
we say hey computer these are cows 
我们说  嘿  电脑  这些都是奶牛

225
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,550
the machine learning model does complicated math on all the images that we give it
在我们提供的所有图片基础上  机器学习的模型会完成非常复杂的数学运算

226
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,899



227
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,659
it extracts features and looks for different patterns in the images

what image is a cow and so on
是一只狗是什么形象是牛  等等

231
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,828
so that's a basic image recognition recap

232
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:33,299
so speech recognition we kind of know how images work
语音识别有点类似我们所接触的图像识别

233
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,000
like you know we can look at something and see patterns

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,258



235
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:37,789
and we can kind of think like okay 
我们会有这样的一些想法

236
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,889
maybe a computer is looking for like certain
活血一台电脑正在寻找

237
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,629
distances on the face of something or
某物表面的一些距离

238
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,230
certain colors but what about speech recognition 
或者某些颜色  但语音识别呢？

239
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,190
we're gonna talk about that
我们接下来就谈谈这个

240
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,480
we're gonna talk about how the computer is able to recognize our speech 
我们来谈谈电脑是怎么样来识别我们的语言的

241
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,980
and able to classify it into different words in our very own language 
并且能够把辨别我们语言中的不同词句

242
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:55,990



243
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,009
so speech recognition quick definition
所以语音识别的简单定义

244
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:02,289
is a machine's ability to identify spoken words
是机器识别口头语言的一种能力

245
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:02,570



246
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,509
so instead of just using mouse keyboard touchscreens 
所以它不需要使用鼠标 键盘 触摸屏

247
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,990
the computer will hear our voice 
计算机会听到我们的声音

248
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,839
and know what words were saying
并且知道是我们说的是什么意思

249
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,578
this is also referred to as speech to text or voice recognition 
说这也被称为  语音转文本  或是语音识别

250
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:15,980



251
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,350
one little caveat speech recognition is different from speech synthesis 
需要提醒的是  语音识别不同于语音合成

252
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,019
so when you're talking to like Siri
所以当你在和Siri对话时

253
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,110
it does both of these tasks tasks 
它包括语音识别与语音合成两项任务

254
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,110
so when you ask Siri something 
所以当你问 Siri一些事情时

255
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,000
that is speech recognition 
这是语音识别

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,059
Siri is recognizing what you're asking it 
Siri意识到你在说什么

257
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,600
it also does speech synthesis 
然后它就会开始语音合成

258
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,629
speech synthesis is when it comes up with words to reply to you 
当它回答你的问题时  这就是语音合成在起作用

259
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:45,240
and it comes back with that iconic Siri voice 
以及Siri那标志性的声音

260
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,448



261
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:48,259
so it tries to put sounds to the words
所以它试图把声音转化成单词

262
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,679
that it's replying to you with
然后回复你的话

263
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,448
so two different things both audio and machine learning related 
所以他们都与音频及机器学习相关  但却是两个不同的东西

264
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,850
but just keep in mind these are two separate areas 
所以只要记住这是两个独立的领域

265
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,750
and today we're going to be focusing on just the recognition 
今天  我们就只关注语音识别

266
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,820
speech recognition is everywhere

00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,629
we talked about Siri a little bit okay 
以及我们刚刚提到的Siri

277
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,210
speech recognition is everywhere and 
语音识别无处不在

283
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,240
so why not be able to interact with our technology that way 
所以为什么不能以说话的方式与科技互动呢？

284
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,590



285
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,140
instead of having the tap and scroll and type all the time 
而不是仅仅靠点击  滚动  输入

286
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,209
what can't we just tell our computer what we want it to do 
什么我们不能告诉我们的电脑我们想要它做什么？

287
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:43,190

295
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,440
and understand those as words and language and sound 
进而理解为不同的单词 语言 和声音

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,679

307
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,250
then we put these ones and zeros into a machine learning model 
然后我们这些1和0输入机器学习的模型中

308
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,720



309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,220
the machine learning model does all kinds of
机器学习模型会将各种各样的

310
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,600
complicated math into the sound signals it's getting
复杂的数学转变为他所获得的声音信号

311
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,990
and it extracts features in the same way 
它的提取特征

312
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,029
that we talked about with the image recognition example of the dog and the cow 
就像我们谈到的识别狗狗与奶牛的图像那样

313
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:52,100



314
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,500
so that's the basic idea of speech recognition 
所以这就是关于语音识别的基本的理念

315
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,000
now let's talk a little bit more about 
现在让我们来谈谈关于

316
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,300
a specific machine learning approach that is used a lot on sound
我们经常运用的 与语音相关的 机器学习的方法

317
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:05,800


318
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:08,590
so this is called a Convnett
这种方法被称作Convnet

319
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,590
also called a convolutional neural network
也称为卷积神经网络

320
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,870
that's the more official name for this 
这是该方法更正式的名称

321
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,259
and the basic idea of it we've already discussed it 
它的基本思路  我们先前已经提到过了

322
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,409
you give it some kind of data 
你提供电脑一些数据

323
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,659
and it extracts features from that data
它会从数据中提取特征

324
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:28,259
each progressive layer is learning a different feature 
从每个渐进分层的数据都是在学习一个不同的特征

325
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,800
so if we think of our dog and cow example 
我们可以联想一下狗狗和奶牛的例子

326
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:31,839



327
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,299
maybe the first layer is learning something super basic 
可能第一层学习的是一些非常基础的东西

328
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,240
like like a line 
比如像一条线 

329
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,259
like an outline of a dog or the outline of a cow
或者是狗的轮廓  或牛的轮廓

330
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:44,070
now the second layer might be learning something a little more specific 
第二层则可能是在学习一些比较具体的东西

331
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,470



332
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,828
like that distance between the eyes that we saw earlier 
比如我们之前看到的 眼睛之间的距离

333
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:50,009
the third layer might be even more specific
第三层可能是更具体的

334
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,458
like combining the distance between the eyes with a certain outline
如结合与两眼之间距离的轮廓

335
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:54,500



336
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,019
with the distance of the ...
以及一些距离

337
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,899
like the length of the nose 
比如鼻子的长度

338
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,939
so each layer big idea here is 
所以这里的每一层  它的整体思路是 

339
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:05,120
each layer in a convolutional neural net 
在卷积神经网络学习中的每一层  

340
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,208
learns a different kind of feature and 
都会学习到 不同类型的特征

341
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:09,319
by combining those features in different ways 
通过不同的方式 组合这些不同的特征

342
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:12,470
it can then tell us what the input data was 
它然后就可以告诉我们  输入的数据是什么

343
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,490
so with sound recognition 
声音识别也是如此

344
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,500
we give it labeled data in the same way
以相同的方式给它标记数据

345
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,549
except instead of handing images of a dog
有别于直接处理狗狗的图像

346
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:23,289
we would say the word dog  
我们会说这只是狗

347
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,899
you just label it dog 
只需要把它标记为狗  

348
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,759
so today we're gonna use the example of cat bed and happy
所以今天我们要用 cat bed 和happy的例子

349
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,099
so we're gonna we have a lot of different examples of these words recorded already
我们录了很多这些单词的发音例子

350
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:35,169



351
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:36,859
and they're all labeled 
而且他们都被贴上了标签

352
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,938
so all we're gonna do is feed these into a neural network 
而我们要做的就是把它们输入神经网络

353
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,929
so like I said we have tons of recordings
就像我们有录制了很多

354
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:49,819
we've got 1700 actually combined of people saying bed 
我们实际上获得了1700个人们说“bed”这个单词的录音

355
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,809
people saying cat and happy 
人们说cat 以及 happy

356
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:52,659
and if you want 
如果你想

357
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,339
you can check for yourself 
你还可以自己检查下

358
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,870
open up any of those folders and listen to any of the file

359
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,778
and you'll see they're all just recordings of people saying that word
你会发现全是人们在说同一个单词的录音

360
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,610



361
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,868
so before we get into some code 
所以在我们得到一些代码之前

362
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:08,808
I want to get you a little excited about speech recognition

00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,069
to feed to our neural network 
然后提供给我们的神经网络

458
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,850
so this get labels

459
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,000
it gets the bed cat and happy labels from our folders  
我们的文件中有着bed cat 和happy的标签

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,970
now this wave to M FCC function right here 
所以这个wave到mfcc这一块代码（蓝色的） 都是在执行这个功能的

461
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,869
this is very important and
这是非常重要的

462
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:55,809
I'm gonna describe this in quite a bit of detail here
我会稍微详细地讲一下这一小块内容

463
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,900



464
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,589
so wave files are very common sound files
所以"wave"文件是非常常见的声音文件

465
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:04,339
so this is essentially 
这是非常基本的知识点

466
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:08,019
if you remember the converter that I was talking about 
如果你还记得我说的转换器

467
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,750
our computers ear drum equivalent that

00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,609
now we could feed this into a neural network

473
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,800
we just feed the image right
我们输入的只是图像对吧？

474
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
we don't do anything to the image before we feed it into the neural network 
在我们导入神经网络前我们没有对图像做任何处理

475
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,199



476
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:36,829
but for audio processing tasks in machine learning 
但对于机器学习中的音频处理任务

477
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:37,129

481
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:51,599



482
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,140
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients

483
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,049
and you don't need to know what that means

484
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,009
but essentially it allows us to
但上它使我们能够 

485
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:06,050
take this raw data that's in just one dimension

490
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,989
so we could feed that raw audio data into our network

491
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:20,000



492
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,970
but transforming it into a

00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,039
when it was classifying audio 
当它对音频进行分类时

501
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,170
so that's what the wave to M FCC function does

514
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,118
save data to array is just so that

553
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,028

560
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,869
the other is the testing set which will
另一部分是测试集

561
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,759
allow us to see how accurate the neural net is

所以你可以想象成 在X训练集里我们有mfcc 1

566
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:55,900



567

and then inside of Y train we've got the label bed 
然后在Y训练集里  我们有所有关于bed的标签

568
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,210
and then underneath that 
然后在这块的下面有MFCC 2

569
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,150
maybe we've got MFCC 2 and the label cat
我们有mfcc 2 和cat的标签

570
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,230
and so on
等等

571

so each each entry into X train is matched up with an entry in Y train
所以每进入一个的X训练集  都会有其对应的Y训练集

572
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:11,140



573
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,440
and X train is going to be the MFCC or the

576
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:24,250
same thing goes for X test and Y test 
X测试和Y测试X也是一样的原理

577
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,200
X test is going to have the actual you know the data the audio data

579
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,000



580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,720
and again these test sets are for testing the accuracy at the very end 
再次说明  这些测试集适用于最后准确性的测试

581
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,450



582
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,800
and the training sets are going to be for training the neural network

583
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,799
so that it can learn what speech is like

584
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,390
so here's some settings 
所以这里有一些设置

585
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,269
we won't go through what all of these settings mean 
我们就在此一一讲述这些设置的功能意义了

586
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:53,069
but these are just settings for the neural network

587
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:53,529


588
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,359
to help us bump up our accuracy a little bit

00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:04,000
you can mess with these but these are pretty good settings

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,450
that should give us pretty good accuracy right off the bed 
能给提供我们相当高的关于“bed”这一词的准确度

592
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,490
okay so
