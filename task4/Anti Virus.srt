94
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,008
it duplicates itself by creating
它会复制自己

more difficult to deal with 
更难处理

111
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,550

have become more common and they've grown in complexity
越来越普遍 而这些病毒越来越复杂  

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,079
the viruses out there that are designed

我们要讲的下一个病毒

116
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,689
is actually going to take us back 
将要把我们带回去一点点


118
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,790
a little bit one step before the Android bomber 
回到安卓恶意软件前

119
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,000
and that's the regular malware virus 
它就是常规的恶意软件病毒

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
some of you might have been wondering at this point
这时候你们有些人可能就觉得奇怪了

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,990
what is malware actually mean well
恶意软件到底是什么

122
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,779
malware means malicious software and

123
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,000
it's any programmer file that's harmful to a computer user
它是任何有害于计算机使用者的程序文件

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,370
now that seems like a very broad definition
看起来似乎定义太过宽泛

125
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,230
but the different types of malware actually narrow it down
但是不同类型的恶意软件能限定它

127
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,000
so the Android malware that we just
所以我们刚谈到的安卓恶意病毒

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,819
talked about is a subset of a malware virus
只是恶意病毒的一部分

129
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,089
now once malware is installed in your computer
一旦你的计算机中安装了恶意软件

130
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,819
it performs unwanted tasks
它会执行你不希望执行的任务

131
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,300

to a third party
给第三方

134
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,449
so people who want to snoop around

135
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,300
and find out what you're doing 
想要知道你在做什么的人

136
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,980

137
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,810
computer to get that information from you 
从你的计算机中获取信息

138
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,930

接下来我们谈谈

139
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,540
technical stages of malware 
恶意软件的技术阶段

140
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,160
I bet some of you were wondering 
你们一定很想知道

141
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,740
well how does it actually work 
恶意软件怎么工作的

142
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,000
now we're going to get into some details here
我们现在就来具体讲讲

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that might seem a little confusing
但可能你会听晕

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,149
so if you have to go ahead and rewind that's okay 
所以如果你一会儿要倒回去再看一遍 完全ok

145
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,550
now what you see here behind me 
在我身后有一张图

146
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,290
is a diagram of how malware works
上面描述了恶意软件如何工作

147
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,850
malware can get into your computer
恶意软件可以进入你的计算机

148
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,000
through say a weak password 
通过 比如说 一个弱密码

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,970
once it's in it performs a statistical analysis on
一旦进入 它就会对你的系统

150
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,310
your system to see if it's interested in
进行数据分析 

151
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,949
taking a closer look at a target file
寻找感兴趣的目标文件

152
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,769
now if it's found that file that it
如果找到该文件

153
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,990
mounts to take a closer look at it then
然后它就会细细分析

154
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,329
performs a dynamic analysis on it and
对它执行动态分析

155
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,730
what it's doing is examining ecstatic properties
它正在做的就是检查属性

156
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,709
so those things about the filethat don't necessarily move 
所以文件不一定会被移动

158
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,079
after that it performs an analysis 
然后 它会对文件储存

159
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,759
on the memory of the file and how the files being used 
进行分析 比如你如何使用文件

161
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,680
or how you're dialing on your phone 
如何打电话

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
or who you're sending text messages to 
和谁发消息

163
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,870
once it's collected all that memory analysis
一旦这些信息被收集

164
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,668
and then sends it back to the person
它们就会被发送给

165
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:32,990
that sent the Malheur to you in the first place

00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,179
usually it requests these ransoms back from you in the form of a crypto currency 
赎金通常形式为加密货币

336
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:27,720
like Bitcoin even after you've paid

351
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,309
artificial intelligence is involved 
人工智能在其中

352
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,899
and tries to make decisions about whether or not
要做出决定

353
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,049
analyzed code is harmful based on a
依据代码的一系列特征

354
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,629
series of the traits of that code now
分析它是否有害

355
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,460
some traits might rank higher than others 
一些特质的危险性可能高于其他

356
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,799
so the code that's determined to

357
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,940
am I not good I might have some traits

359
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,100
that the software considers to be possible indications of malware

364
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,240
we're gonna get into the various techniques
我们要进入机器学习

365
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,519
used by machine learning for antivirus building
用于杀毒软件的一些方式

366
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,000
and they've come into two major categories 
他们分可为两大类

367
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,259
on the one hand you have anomaly detection 
一类是异常检测

368
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,000
that's what we just talked about a little earlier 
就是我们刚刚讲到的

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,259
and then on the other hand you have Bayesian classification
另一类是贝叶斯分类

371
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,000
we're going to get intodetail on that one a little later
我们稍后会详细介绍那个

373
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,409
so I hope you're excited to figure out 
希望你很高兴知道

374
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,659
how machine learning actually helps fight the virus 
机器学习是如何打败病毒的

375
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,000
how is the nomally detection used for virus detection 
异常检测是如何进行的

376
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
well it scans code for unusual behavior
它扫描查找异常行为

377
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,889
and when it finds a piece of unusual behavior 
当它发现异常行为

379
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,590
which we call an outlier 
我们称它为异常值， 

380
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,200
it flags it as a potential virus
它将其标记为潜在的病毒

381
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,389
and what it tries to do is identify patterns 
它在做的其实就是

382
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,300
that don't conform to expected behavior
识别与预期不同的模式

383
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,889
people who make anomaly detection software actually admit that
那些创造异常检测的人承认

385
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,000
there are some attck that they allowed to go through on a network 
有一些攻击是没办法检测出来的

386
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,389
because they can't get everything
因为他们并不拥有所有信息

387
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,568
now this means that hundreds of machines
这意味着数以百计的计算机

388
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:25,759
are being compromised before an attack is detected
在检测之前 可能已经受到攻击

389
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,399
once it's detected it's isolated 
 一旦检测出异常 它将被孤立

390
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,159
and your system is protected from it
你的系统将受到保护

392
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,560
okay now we've gone through an Amelie detection
好啦 我们现在已经讲完艾米莉检测啦

393
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,000
the next major category if you remember is Bayesian classifiers 
下一个要讲的 如果你还记得 是贝叶斯分类器

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that there's a lot of math coming up in these next two slides 
在接下来的两页幻灯片中  会有很多的数学

396
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
so you have to rewind and re-watch that's okay
如果你要倒带重看 完全没问题

398
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,900
I'm actually going to take a step out of the screen for a minute
在接下里的几分钟里 我要先从屏幕上消失

399
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,000
so that you can see everything as I go through this
这样在我讲的时候 你就能看到全部内容

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,409
first let's talk about what a Bayesian classifier is 
我们首先谈谈什么是贝叶斯分类器

402
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:00,000
a Bayesian classifier calculates probabilities for every different event 
贝叶斯分类器计算每一个不同事件的概率

404
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,489
here in the example that we're going to be using in these next two slides 
在这两页的幻灯片中

405
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:07,000
we're really going to be talking about two things 
我们将会谈论两个东西

406
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,120
smoke and fire
烟雾和火灾

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,149
what we do is we figure out the probability
我们要弄清楚的就是

408
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,119
of smoke given that there's fire
看到烟雾 有火的概率

409
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,369
that first bullet there
屏幕上的第一个标记处

410
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,009
where you see the P with a bar then a B
你可以看到P（a|b） 

411
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:25,000
that's the probability of a given the probability of B
它的意思是在B情况下a的概率是多少

412
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,708
now when we talk about a
我们谈论的a

413
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,350
what we really need is fire 
也就是火

414
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,999
so if you want it in your head and you want to put in fire for a
如果你想在你脑海中记住 a就是火

415
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:33,220
you're more than welcome to do that 
那再好不过了

416
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,009
the example that we have here is
我们接下来要做的

417
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,629
we're going to try and find out the
就是尝试找出

418
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:41,808
probability of fire given that we see smoke
看到烟雾情况下火灾的概率

419
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:43,558
and we find this out by knowing
通过知道

420
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:46,119
what the probabilities of smoke and fire are
烟和火的概率

421
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,399
and then doing a little bit of math
然后做一些计算

422
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,499
to figure out the probability of fire
我们便可以得出

423
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,668
given that me see smoke 
看到烟雾情况下火灾的概率

424
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:55,500
okay so these are the basic things that we're looking at
这是我们寻找的基本的东西

425
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,089
but I want you to take a moment
但是我想让你停下来

426
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,730
to observe this slide
仔细看看这张幻灯片

427
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,400
read it through and think about it
仔细阅读并且好好想一想

428
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,568
on the next slide we're actually going to 
在下一页幻灯片中 我们将要

429
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,148
go through a step by step example using our smoke and fire
一步步的讲解烟与火的例子

430
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:10,888
so that you really understand what a Bayesian classifier is
以便你真正理解贝叶斯分类器

432
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,778
I'm here even though you can't see me now 
我在这里 虽然你现在看不到我

433
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:15,388
I'm gonna walk you through this step by step
我将带你一步步分解问题

434
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:18,109
the question is when I see smoke
问题是看到烟雾的时候

435
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,548
what's the chance that there's also going to be fire
有火的概率是多大呢

436
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,369
I'm going to break it down for you
听我仔细道来

437
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,630
first let's talk about the top half of the screen
首先让我们来谈谈的屏幕上半部分

439
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,588
then we're going to talk about the bottom half
然后我们再谈谈下半部分

440
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,319
the top half of the screen gives us information that we know about
屏幕上半部分告诉我们一些信息

442
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,000
so let's talk about the probability of fire given that there's smoke
所以让我们来谈谈在有烟情况下有火的概率

444
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,640
we know that there's a 90% chance that fire can create smoke 
我们知道有火情况下有烟的可能性是90％

446
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,900
we also know that there's a 10% chance of there just being fire without smoke 
我们也知道有火情况下无烟的概率是10%

448
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,630
and a 1% chance that you can create smoke without fire
有烟却没有火的概率是1%

449
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,390
knowing those three things we can find out the
知道这三样东西 我们便可以

450
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,880
probability of there being smoke given that we see a fire
得出有火情况下有烟的概率

451
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,549
but what we're gonna do is 
我们接下来

452
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,800
we're gonna say P of smoke with the bar fire
会说P（smoke|fire）

453
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,849
which basically means the probability of smoke given that there's a fire
它的意思是有火情况下有烟的概率

455
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:15,000
it is gonna be 1% that's our chance of just smoke
有烟没有火的概率是1%

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,809
multiplied by 90% which is
乘以90％ 即是

457
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,210
our chance that there's fire given that there is  smoke
有烟情况下有火

458
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,000
over 10% 
除以10％

459
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,910
which is our chance of they're just being fire 
即 有火却无烟 

460
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,000
now if we do the math what we come up with 
我们进行计算 便可得出

461
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,490
is a 9% chance of there being smoke when there's fire 
9% 有火情况下有烟的概率

462
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,579
now like I said if you have to rewind and go over this again
如果你需要倒带重看一遍

463
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,650
until you understand it that's okay 
知道你彻底理解 完全没问题

465
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,349
I know that we just went over something pretty tough
我们刚刚学习了非常难的知识

466
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:45,940
great job everyone going over how Bayesian classifiers work

476
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,339
they're also used to classify whether or
它们也可用于检测

477
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,440
not your computer is affected or safe
你的计算机是否安全

478
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,109
they do this using probabilities of things that they know
它们通过已知概率来做到这一点

479
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,859
and then they go through the Bayesian classifier to
