21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,899
is all of the benefits that chatbots can bring to us ok

25
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,009
progressing technology and

they take voice and text instructions

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,010
so text instructions so that's huge

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,950
because using our voice using language that's
因为我们使用声音  使用语言

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,200
how humans have interacted with the world for thousands of years

all we had was our language

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,760
so why not allow us to interact with our technology that way

touch a screen or stroke a key

39
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,909
so chop us are huge for that

40
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,709
use our natural language to interact with tech 
我们因而可以用自然语言与科技互动

41
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:59,040
another advantage always on 24 7 baby just leave it plugged in

68
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:10,329

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,589



83
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:54,600

00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,900
I probably butchered his name I hope it's close to correct

100
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:40,999



101

and popularize it to where it is today

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,240
so now I'd like to compare the

traditional user experience of having an app on your phone

107
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:01,529
say and you know tapping around two different screens

108
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:01,579



109
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:07,129
versus a newer type of user experience where we've got chatbots
与如今拥有聊天机器人  的新型用户体验相比

110
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,800
so with a traditional app 
传统的应用程序

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,568
you know it's on your phone 
它在你的手机里

112

your taping your scrolling your typing

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,589
you know  we're all used to that type of user interaction

this new functionality of interacting with things with our voice okay 
一种用我们的声音进行交互的新功能

00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:35,969
so I don't have to be holding a piece of technology in my hand 
所以我没有我不需要手持一项技术

120
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:35,999



121
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,990
I can shout at something across the room

126
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:57,000
traditional hard coded touching tapping scrolling apps that were used to on our phone
因为我们传统的应用程序 需要通过触屏 打字 滑动 来交互

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,100


128
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,209

it came out awful

138
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,658
like one of the main ingredients was ketchup
好像其中一个主要成分是番茄酱

139
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:29,718



140
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:37,848
but yeah so chatbots shouldn't be used everywhere in every case 
所以使用聊天机器人  也应该分地点  分场合

141
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:40,180
but they can be used a lot of places
但他们可以运用在很多场合

142
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,408

they're very useful in a lot of places
它们在很多地方都非常有用

144
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,538
so let's talk about three different types of chatbots 
所以我们来谈谈三个不同类型的聊天机器人

145
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:50,000
and kind of like different levels of usability

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,949
so at the highest level we've got contextual 
所以在最高级别  我们有上下文

147
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:54,018



148
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:58,829
now this is a chatbot that understands you
这是一个了解你的聊天机器人

149
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:01,199
okay it's like it gives this really good
好吧  它能够给你一种非常棒的

150
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,869
illusion of understanding what you're saying 
错觉  还想它真的懂你  所说的话

151
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:08,858
so here's an example of a Pizza ordering chatbot
比如说  一个披萨订餐的聊天机器人

152
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:12,588
so you say hey I'd like to order a pizza 
你说  嘿  我想要订一个披萨

153
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:16,809
and the chatbot remembers that the last time you ordered
聊天机器人还记得你上一次预订的

154
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:16,889



155
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,009
and it might even be time related
甚至连时间上都有相似点

156
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,259
maybe this guy ordered a pizza at like 8:30 a.m. last time 
可能这家伙上一次  在早上8点30分订了披萨

157
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,639
and the chatbots like
聊天机器人可能会说  

158
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,000
hey last time you ordered at 8:30 a.m.

you ordered this things

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,829
chatbots use information like the time previous order history things like that

161
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,689
to get more of an idea to get context

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,928
so that's the highest level of chatbot interaction 
这是聊天机器人  互动的最高水平

165
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:52,828
we've also got a step lower

166
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,269
these are much easier to program and

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,009



169
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,599
are keyword recognition based chatbots
主要是一些关键字识别的聊天机器人

170
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,129
so these do what they say the name is self-explanatory

171
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,038
you talk to the chatbot

172
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,519
and all it does is look for certain keywords in your speech

173
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,988
to either present you with more options

175
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:17,988



176
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,969
so here we see Casey Phillips asking something to pointbot

287
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,629
so another type of model used in NLP is

288
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,909
sequence-to-sequence now what this is
“sequence-to-sequence”（序列-序列） 这是什么呢

289
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,629
it uses two steps an encoder step and a

290
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:36,000
decoder step so what the encoder step

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,519
does is it takes sequences of characters
它会将字符

292
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,090
or words and just bits of language and
或单词和一部分语言

293
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,220
it turns them into numbers
的序列转化成数字

294
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,860
okay gives them a number representation
也就是给了它们一个数字表示

295
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,490
and then it goes through a thought vector

296
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,360
which is it's like a an

297
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,129
artificial kind of thinking process

298
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:03,029
where the decoder tries to think of a

299
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,449
good response to the text that was encoded 
已被编码的文本进行反应

300
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:09,340
so what the decoder does is

301
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,870
it thinks of some numbers it generates some
想到一些数字 生成新的数字

302
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,359
new numbers and decodes them back into words

303
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,800
which is what we originally fed into the model 
我们刚输入编码器时候的字词

304
00:14:120,800 --> 00:14:23,070
so encoder turns the
所以编码器将

305
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,490
words into a number representation
单词转换为数字表示

306
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,500
decoder thinks of some new numbers that

307
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,259
it can use and turns those numbers into

00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,950
a word representation giving you your response

309
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,950
here's an example of a sequence
这里有一个“序列-序列”

310
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,190
to sequence mechanism

311
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,769
they can be used with multiple inputs
它可以通过多端输入

312
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,440
going into very few outputs to do cool

313
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,579
things like translate Chinese into English

so it's a nice little image right there 
屏幕上的图像就是展示了这个过程

315
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,250
another type of model that

316
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,040
are used in chatbots are
chatbot（聊天机器人）上的模型是

317
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,279
long short-term memory units

318
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,929
now the name is kind of confusing and these confused me
这个名字听起来还挺让人困惑的 至少它确实困惑了我

319
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,870
for a long time but on a very basic
很长一段时间 基本上来说

320
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,570
level the idea behind these is each
这个模型背后的理念就是

321
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,190
building block of these networks 
构建这些网络 

322
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,179
they each have a

323
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,220
short-term memory associated with them

324
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,190
and each layer can pass its short-term
每层都可以将它的短期

325
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,399
memory on to the later levels of the network 
记忆内容传递到之后的层里

326
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,960
so this is why it's called the
这就是为什么它被称为

327
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,940
long short-term memory they can only
“长短时记忆” 因为它们

328
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,509
retain small bits of memory but these

329
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,110
small bits of memory are passed on layer
短时的记忆内容都可以

330
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,299
by layer by layer to give the illusion

331
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:38,120
of long-term memory

332
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,289
yeah here's some books on chatbots

oh I forgot we used lists trainer

it needs the language examples in a list

we go into Gibraltar cool 
耶 我们可以去直布罗陀啦 太帅了

436
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,999
so there you go there's a chatbot obviously very basic

00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,549
chatbot code that could be written out
写出代码来做出一个

443
