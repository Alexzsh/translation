outperforming human behavior so the
比人类做得更好

133
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,228
natural question is can artificial
所以自然而然 有人就问了

134
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:20,019
intelligence algorithm fail well the
算法可能出错吗

135
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,600
answer is yes and it has before in the
答案是肯定的 过去就发生过

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,478
past now the reason why these algorithms
算法出错的原因是

137
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,500
fail is because they are programmed by
它们是人类经过数学计算

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,819
people using mathematics and they sent
所进行的编程 并且人类会为不同的行为

139
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,350
different thresholds for different behaviors
设定不同的阈值

140
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,379
 as a matter of fact the stock

00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,228
market lost trillions of dollars for 38
股票市场在38分钟内

142
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,930

143
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,300
trading like this all the algorithms
究其原因 是这些算法

144
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,430
were set to a similar threshold and when
 它们的阈值被设定的相似

145
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,410
stocks reached that threshold they

146
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,139
immediately sold off all their holdings
人们就会立刻卖掉了所有的股份

147
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,079
creating this flash crash we're gonna
然后就崩盘了 

148
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,370
start getting into some technical
我们将要进一步了解

149
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,560
details about how these algorithms work
这些算法的运作原理

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,709
in order to do that we need to take a
为了做到这一点 

151
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,418
step back and talk about what the
我们要退一步 

152
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:04,910
difference is between classification and regression
讲讲分类和回归的区别

153
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,399
the main difference between the two of them
他们的主要区别

154
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,000
is the type of output that they give you
是输出的类型

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,149
for classification problems and algorithm 
分类问题及其算法

157
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:14,680
is designed to give you an output 
旨在告诉你

158
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,709
that tells you a specific thing whether or not 
一件具体的事情

159
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,350
say for example something is a dog a fish or a cat
例如某种东西是狗是鱼还是猫

160
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,069
with regression problems the output that the algorithm 
而对于回归问题

161
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:28,160
tries to give you is the value of some number 
算法输出的是数值

162
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,640
now when we're talking about financial technology
现在我们讲的是金融科技

164
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,408
the algorithms typically what we want to
算法通常旨在

165
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,358
find out are things like stock prices
找出像股票价格这样的东西

166
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:37,600
we're going to get into regression a little more detail
所以我们要具体讲讲回归

167
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,528
now what is linear regression
什么是线性回归

168
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:41,658
well it's actually fairly simple
其实很简单

169
