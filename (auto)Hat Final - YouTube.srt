I chose Ronald Weasley because he is one of my favorite

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,300
for Hufflepuff i chose Ceedric Diggory found some wonderful quotes by him
赫奇帕奇里我选了塞德里克 找到了一些很棒的话

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,940
Slytherin of course draco malfoy was my

103
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,010
go-to character and then for Ravenclaw

104
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,570
luna lovegood who is not so good so good

105
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,170
she's awesome

106
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,350
[Music]

107
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,640
alright so then we have we have those

108
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,620
and you do need a lot of them afraid to

109
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,840
say I did not try with just five of each

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,950
but I presume that you do need ten all

111
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,530
right once we have done so then then

112
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,170
then then we go back to project you may

113
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,550
be wondering Walker why did you move

114
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,470
over to the side well we're about to

115
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,960
find out as we move to the next stage

116
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,330
the next stage is where we create the

117
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,890
magic the magic is about to happen

118
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,650
ladies and gentlemen get excited what

119
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,050
we're gonna do is enter into the Hall of

120
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,930
elements by pressing you learn and test

121
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,930
button magical then we shall do the

122
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,410
sorcery the sorcery is enacted by waving

123
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,390
our wand very precipitously and then

124
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,120
clicking on this button here yes when we

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,190
do this it'll take some time the magic

126
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,669
takes time but once it is complete then

127
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,310
we have a magical hat

128
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,630
the reason I'm over to the side is so

129
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,979
that I don't block the button that is

130
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,419
the magic behind that

131
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,100
so let us enact the magic alrighty this

132
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,479
hopefully is what we see on our screen

133
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,100
now or something very similar to it

134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,650
because this tells us that the magic

135
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,640
that we have conjured up has done

136
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,040
something something's happened now let's

137
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,590
say we're trying to turn a cat into a

138
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,890
dog a cat into a cup a lamp a house

139
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,680
whatever maybe a dragon okay we're just

140
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,810
trying to turn it into something in this

141
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,610
instance we're trying to turn our

142
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,700
computer into a hat of course that's

143
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
that's what we're trying to do now this

144
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,810
doesn't mean that it actually turned it

145
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,390
into a hat that works so let's let's

146
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,640
test it let's see if this this guy works

147
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,169
I hope I hope that analogy made some

148
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,820
sense we're gonna check if this works

149
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,050
that's what we're doing now alright so

150
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,760
we're gonna go back we're gonna go into

151
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,610
scratch we're gonna open it in scratch

152
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,470
we're gonna open it and scratch their

153
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,199
scratch and here is the portion where

154
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,849
you get to have a little bit of fun a

155
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,110
little bit of more funds for our having

156
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,719
a great time to make some artwork yeah

157
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,330
get to make some fancy pantsy hats so

158
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,770
you can stick with the wizard hat if

159
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,879
you'd like you don't have to give it a

160
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,729
face you can you can also do a top hat

161
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,199
you could do a fedora you could do a

162
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,960
gown it's not a gown a tiara that's what

163
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,400
it's called thinking like Cinderella

164
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,979
stuff and even one of those hats with

165
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,169
the cool little pinwheels on top they're

166
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,719
like the propellers do it's a thing I

167
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,979
don't know what's called the cool

168
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,379
after you do this you're going to create

169
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,319
the script oh the script is script

170
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,840
descriptive yes yes yes

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,550
it's gonna look like this these are they

172
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,039
gonna be the general framework of it

173
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,710
make sure you change the the text that

174
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,669
it will say do something reasonable once

175
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:31,930
you have done so you will arrive at

176
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,310
something you're making fun of my

177
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,139
artwork right now aren't you you're

178
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,789
making fun of that well guess what me

179
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,789
and my mom both think it's amazing so

180
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,370
it's amazing there it is I'm a great

181
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,550
artist and there's that all right we

182
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,069
have our script we have our our model is

183
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,389
implemented here it's all this stuff

184
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,409
right here we're ready we're ready to

185
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,500
see if our magic has created a good hat

186
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,750
let's see how well our hat works

187
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,060
let us try some exact exact of Mundo

188
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,860
quotes from the draco malfoy himself

189
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,740
yeah so one of the things that draco

190
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,560
malfoy said was honestly if you were any

191
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,159
slower you'd be going backwards what a

192
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,490
charmer what a nice guy so this is a

193
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,240
data point that we trained them this is

194
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,000
the exact word egde that the model

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,589
learned so if it doesn't give a slither

196
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,990
and something is horribly awry and we

197
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,969
may be doing pyromancy when we thought

198
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,709
we were a frost mage so let's find out I

199
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:41,919
know about you but I was nervous what

200
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,570
this means is that at the very minimum

201
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,770
our hat has learned to memorize yes all

202
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,870
right let's look at some

203
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,830
other things that Ronald Weasley has

204
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,580
spoken so one of the things he said is

205
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,450
don't let the muggles get you down for

206
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,160
anyone who doesn't know muggles are you

207
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,380
and me the people without magical powers

208
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,480
now we are gaining our magical powers

209
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,250
through the power of machine learning so

210
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,339
very soon we're gonna get our message in

211
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,710
the mail from the owls to hop on

212
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,720
Hogwarts and it will be awesome where we

213
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,210
learn to be full-fledged wizards

214
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,150
handedly amazing so here it worked it

215
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,750
actually worked

216
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,790
now we're going to try something a

217
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,800
little bit ambitious in fact so

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,690
ambitious that is the word that we're

219
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,520
going to use because chem vicious is

220
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,279
associated with the house of Slytherin

221
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,029
ambition at all costs so let's see if it

222
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,610
learned it it didn't it didn't learn it

223
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,190
what I want all this work I'm using the

224
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,680
magic of machine learning in here it

225
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
doesn't even learn that Slytherin is

226
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,650
ambitious

227
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,720
it's a bad hat yeah actually you're

228
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,140
right

229
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,029
you're not even ruffled you're correct

230
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,920
it's not a great hat okay

231
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,690
it's learned let's learn to memorize

232
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,459
okay it's learned a little bit about

233
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,290
Ronald Weasley it's learned a little bit

234
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,170
about Draco Malfoy look at that face but

235
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,770
it's not learned Slytherin

236
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,690
it is not learned Gryffindor and all

237
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,010
that that means if you watch those

238
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,870
movies if read those books but you like

239
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,320
get that so well so how did we get our

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,589
hat to be even better one of the things

241
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,290
you will hear more and more if you are

242
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,089
in the realm of data science at all

243
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,350
is more data you need more data you know

244
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,360
you need to see more of the you know

245
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,980
more about Harry Potter and more about

246
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,930
Hermione and all these famous Gryffindor

247
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,520
characters and then eventually you may

248
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,890
realize like okay I'm understanding the

249
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,950
essence of what it means to be a

250
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,450
Gryffindor or whatever so with our small

251
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,880
10 samples we've really learned because

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,440
what we trained on particularly was

253
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,230
quotes by Draco so we're gonna learn

254
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,180
Draco pretty well but he's not all of

255
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,190
Slytherin we've learned Ronald Weasley

256
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,720
pretty well but not necess

257
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,270
all of Gryffindor because I guess kind

258
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,500
of cheated if you want to say it like

259
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,350
that but that's what we have done and as

260
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,780
we see it works well for what we trained

261
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,980
on but if we look for things that we

262
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,810
have not trained on we probably need

263
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,840
more data to get a better vision of the

264
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,610
magical world all righty

265
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,380
we've made it ladies and gentlemen

266
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,710
welcome welcome to Hogwarts where we

267
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,420
learn with Sheena learning all day long

268
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,040
and become better wizards and more

269
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,800
friendly people all the day long we done

270
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,720
today what have we done well we created

271
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,480
a hat what does this hat do wonderful

272
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,420
question this hat is a classifier hat

273
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,520
all right so we have four classes right

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,920
we have our Gryffindor's we have our

275
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,380
slytherins and we have a hufflepuffs and

276
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,660
what we want to do is we want to tell is

277
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,610
this person just does he fit in here

278
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,500
does he is easy as leather is this ass

279
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,670
leather in person this is a is this a

280
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,190
ravenclaw see so Hufflepuff or perhaps a

281
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,330
Gryffindor now as we see it wasn't it

282
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,340
wasn't it wasn't easy okay it learns

283
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,710
some things but it didn't learn all

284
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,270
things and maybe your model when you

285
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,220
test it you know it does actually well

286
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,110
or it doesn't do very well on on certain

287
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,090
things and there many things we can do

288
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,370
to get that better but even the best

289
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,740
Wizards in the land I'm talking I'm

290
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,720
talking Godric Gryffindor I'm talking

291
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm talking Harry Potter himself a

292
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,400
Dumbledore perhaps even dare I say it's

293
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,260
Voldemort that's right I said it

294
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,780
I did it they even have a hard time with

295
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,790
this okay these are very very difficult

296
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,160
spells to master natural language

297
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,960
processing is the type of magic that

298
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,850
this is this is not pyromancy we're not

299
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,770
being a frost mage or even a necromancer

300
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,110
okay this is known as natural language

301
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,420
processing because language it's natural

302
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,910
it's what we speak talking about wizards

303
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,890
and whatever and we want to you know

304
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,930
process this information we won't want

305
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,790
to know stuff about what we're saying

306
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,470
that's literally what that means is

307
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,940
knowing what the heck we're talking

308
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,400
about so it's really really hard and

309
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,730
even Dumbledore has a hard time so what

310
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,810
this means is that there's a ton of

311
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,760
research being done to this there are

312
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,860
great minds great Wizards doing

313
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,490
incredible things all over the globe to

314
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,530
attempt to get better at understanding

315
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,570
words so as we can see with our half

316
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,430
that we made here we can do some things

317
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,130
but it's still very hard so I hope we

318
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,400
have

319
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,860
sited some excitement towards the magic

320
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,690
of this great new realm known as natural

321
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,740
language processing also known as words

322
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,600
so once again this is Walker Stipe from

323
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,780
Palo Alto education hoping that you have

324
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,910
a wonderful wonderful day thank you and

325
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,120
goodbye
